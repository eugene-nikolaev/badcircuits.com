Recently, I was needed to remove a small bimetall thermostate from a slow-cooker. It was screwed by two small nuts (apparently their size was M3).

Usually I unscrew nuts like those with small plieers but there was no room to put it into.
Small adjustuble wrench was too thick and it is not very handy as it always loses its setting.

I often encountered this the issue so that time I wanted to finally solve it using more adequate approach.
Well, I needed a small wrench kit.
After some long search, I found this wrench kit (7 pieces) on ebay:

[7-PC-Mini-Cranked-Wrench-3-mm-5-5-mm-model-engineering-hobby](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338194349&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F7-pc-Mini-gekr%25F6pften-Schraubenschl%25FCssel-3-mm-5-5-mm-Model-Engineering-Hobby%2F162653716647)

As you can see, one end is straight and other is cranked to 80Â°.

Length: 75-80mm.

Sizes: 3/3,2/3,5/4/4,5/5/5,5 mm.

It has pretty exotic sizes, the kit is positioned for model engineering.

Quality is very good, it was sent from UK and shipping was not that long (2-3 weeks).
