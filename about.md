# Why **Bad** Circuits?

* Actually, I wanted "**Mad** Circuits" but it was taken
* From Urban Dictionary:
> bad: dope, good, tight
* Circuits may be clunky or just broken (I am interested in repair, too)
* Sometimes they are really bad because I hasn't learnt them yet in practice

# Affiliate/associate programs notice

Some links on this blog can lead to eBay pages, etc.<br>
They are linked with my affiliate/associate programs for those platforms.<br>
If you click a link and then buy something there - I'll get a little reward.<br>
This is not a main purpose of the blog - I really use those items and I try to point them as well.<br>
Sometimes an original seller doesn't exist anymore or an item was gotten some other way so I try to make an appropriate substitution.<br>
Please feel free to post a comment to a corresponding post if you can propose another seller, etc.
